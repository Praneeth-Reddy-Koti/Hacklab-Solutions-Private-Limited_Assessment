The process of estimating the parameters of a camera is called camera calibration.
This means we have all the information (parameters or coefficients) about the camera required to determine an accurate relationship between a 3D point in the real world and its corresponding 2D projection (pixel) in the image captured by that calibrated camera.
 
Write a python script to automatically find the camera calibration parameters using a 6x8 checkerboard pattern.
Record a video (or share photographs) to show how the calibration setup works.
